#  Neural Style Transfer

##  Overview

This project applies the artistic style of one image (like a painting) to another image (like a photograph) using Neural Style Transfer, a deep learning technique.

For example:

- **Content Image**: A photo of a mountain
- **Style Image**: Van Goghâ€™s Starry Night
- **Output**: A mountain photo painted in the style of Starry Night

##  What It Does

- Takes two input images:
  - A content image (what you want to change)
  - A style image (how you want it to look)
- Combines them using a deep neural network
- Outputs a new image that blends content and style

---

## Why It's Useful

- Turn your photos into artwork automatically
- Learn how deep learning can separate "content" and "style"
- Great for creative and educational projects

---

## How It Works (Simple Steps)

1. Load the content and style images
2. Use a pre-trained neural network 
3. Extract features of both images
4. Generate a new image that matches the content of one and the style of the other
